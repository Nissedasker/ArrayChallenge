# ArrayChallenge
This is a challenge in Array manipulation.
1. Check out Master and write a class that implements the functions defined in the 'ArrayMethods' interface.
2. The Main method should first instantiate the array-manipulating object.
3. Create a jumbled array and print the sum of its elements.
4. Sort the jumbled array and print the sum of its elements to verify we get the same number.

Second part is to check out the branch called 'BuggySolution' that is attempting to implement the methods in the interface, but there is a catch ...... it's buggy, and you have to identify and fix the bug(s).
