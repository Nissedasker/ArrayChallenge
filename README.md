# ArrayChallenge
This is a 2-part challenge in Array manipulation.

Part 1
1. Check out Master and write a class that implements the functions defined in the 'ArrayMethods' interface.
2. The Main method should first instantiate the array-manipulating object.
3. Create a jumbled array and print the sum of its elements.
4. Sort the jumbled array and print the sum of its elements to verify we get the same number.

Part 2
1. Check out the branch called 'BuggySolution' and make sure the project compiles.
2. Run the main class and verify it successfully runs to the end.
3. Here is the challenge... all 3 methods are buggy and you have to identify and fix the bug(s)
  a. The summarizer has something interesting happen at array sizes >= 443.
  b. The initial array creation has issues with the numbers.
  c. The bubble sorting method isn't sorting as expected.
