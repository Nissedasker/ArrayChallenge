# ArrayChallenge
This is a 2-part challenge in Array manipulation.

Part 1
1. Check out Master and write a class that implements the functions defined in the 'ArrayMethods' interface.
2. The Main method should first instantiate the array-manipulating object.
3. Create a jumbled array and print the sum of its elements.
4. Sort the jumbled array and print the sum of its elements to verify we get the same number.

Part 2
1. Check out the branch called 'BuggySolution' and compile the project to make sure everything is set up.
2. Run the main class and verify it can run.
3. ... all 3 methods are buggy and you have to identify and fix the bug(s) - the summarizer has something interesting happen at array sizes >= 443.
